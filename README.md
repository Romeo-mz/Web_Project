# Web Development Project Folder

This folder is intended to store all of my future web development projects.

## Contents

Each project will have its own subfolder with the project name and a README.md file describing the project, technologies used, and instructions on how to run the project.

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to store and document my web development projects for future reference and easy collaboration with other developers.
